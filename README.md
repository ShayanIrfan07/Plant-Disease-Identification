This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for identifying plant diseases from images of leaves. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, the model aims to accurately classify and diagnose various plant diseases. This can help farmers and gardeners in early detection and treatment, improving crop health and yield.
